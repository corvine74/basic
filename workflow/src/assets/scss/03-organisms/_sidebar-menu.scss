	SIDE-BAR MENU
	========== */
	
	/* 
		Local navigation for a subset of pages or section of a website, intended to appear in a sidebar adjacent to the main content. It can accommodate multiple categories/sub-sections in a two-level hierarchy with titles corresponding to the top level page of each sub-section. See the article demo page for an example in better context.

			* Side-Bar Menu Demo -- https://protocol.mozilla.org/demos/article.html
		
		Notes
			* The menu summary reflects the current page, shown when the menu is collapsed in small viewports. The menu label should be the title of the site section.

		Tips
			* Indicate the current page with the mzp-is-current class.
