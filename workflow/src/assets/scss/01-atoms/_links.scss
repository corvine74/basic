/* ==========
	Text Links
	========== */
	/* 
		Just your standard inline text link with no modifiers. Font family, size, weight, etc are inherited from the parent.

		Notes
			Links can appear in a number of states: unvisited, visited, hovered, active, and focused. It’s hard to display these states visually while keeping this component accurate to reality, so we’ve set up a separate demo page to show all the link states in one place.

		Tips
			* Keep link text short, just a few words.
			* The text in a link should be descriptive of the destination or offer some clear indication of where the link leads.
			*You can use the light-links mixin for dark background where links require higher text contrast.

/* ==========
	ZAP
	========== */
	/* 
		The zap is a florish that can be added to Firefox themed sites to give emphasis to one word.

		Notes
			For localization purposes the theme class for the zap goes on the parent element and the zap is applied to any child <strong> tags.

			Add the class mzp-has-zap-1, and change the number 1 to the number of the zap you want. There are 18 zaps to choose from.

			If you want to apply the zap in a different manner, or use a zap that's not one of the default ones you can use the zap('zap.svg') mixin.

		Tips
			* zaps cannot break to a new line, so they should only be put on one word
			* the zap is flexible! it can be used on words of various sizes
			* zaps will work best on large text
			* zaps with a lot of detail don't work as well on short words
