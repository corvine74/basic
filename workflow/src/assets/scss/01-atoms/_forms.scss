/* ========== 
	FORMS 
	========== */

/* 
	Base - Protocol core contains some basic form styles which include:
		* normalization of display between browsers
		* styles for fieldset, legend, input, select
		* utility classes for errors and error messages
	
	Depending on what you're doing this might be enough. For more complex layouts, status information, and custom UI options see the form components.

/* ==========
	TEXT INPUT 
	========== */
	/*
		Form inputs should always (or almost always) be paired with a label element.
		* MDN <input> -- https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input
		* MDN <label> -- https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTML/Element/label
	*/



/* ==========
	INPUT WITH PLACEHOLDER 
	========== */
	/*
		Field placeholders should show an example of the expected input, such as suggested search terms or a demonstration of a correctly formatted email address.
	*/



/* ========== 
	CHECKBOXES 
	========== */
	/*
		Checkboxes represent a set of options where multiple selections are allowed.
		
		Tips
			* Wrap the label element around both the control and its text label. This gives a bigger target for clicking.
			* Use the mzp-u-inline class to override the base block-level label styling.
			* Use a single checkbox for a binary choice (such as a yes or no question) rather than two radio buttons, especially if the field isn’t required. A checked radio button can’t be unchecked, whereas a single checkbox behaves as a switch to let a user toggle between the two states (you can uncheck a checked checkbox).

/* ========== 
	RADIO BUTTONS 
	========== */
	/*
		Radio buttons represent a set of options where only one may be selected.
	
		Tips
			* Wrap the label element around both the control and its text label. This gives a bigger target for clicking.
			* Use the mzp-u-inline class to override the base block-level label styling.

			* MDN <fieldset> -- https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTML/Element/fieldset
			* MDN <legend> -- https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTML/Element/legend

		Tips
			Use meaningful elements like lists and paragraphs to give forms structure.
	*/



/* ==========
	TITLE 
	========== */
	/*
		There are two classes for styling titles (aka headings) that appear in forms.

		Tips
			* Make sure the html content is semantic and communicates the heirarchy before you apply these classes
			* You will get the subtitle styles automatically when using a <legend> element
	*/

	/*
		A note to provide added context or instructions to supplement the field label. It should be inside the label element, after the label text.
