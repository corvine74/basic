// Forms
// 
// Base - Protocol core contains some basic form styles which include:
// * normalization of display between browsers
// * styles for fieldset, legend, input, select
// * utility classes for errors and error messages
//
//  Depending on what you're doing this might be enough. For more complex layouts, status information, and custom UI options see the form components.


// Text Input
// Form inputs should always (or almost always) be paired with a label element.



// Input with Placeholder
// Field placeholders should show an example of the expected input, such as suggested search terms or a demonstration of a correctly formatted email address.



// Other Input Fields
//
// * file
// * search
// * email
// * date
// * password



// Checkboxes
// Checkboxes represent a set of options where multiple selections are allowed.



// Radio Buttons
// Radio buttons represent a set of options where only one may be selected.



// Select



// Textarea



// Fieldset with Legend
// Use fieldset to group related fields together. Include a legend as a title.



// Title
// There are two classes for styling titles (aka headings) that appear in forms



// Field Notes
// A note to provide added context or instructions to supplement the field label. It should be inside the label element, after the label text.



// Required Field
// Inputs that are required to submit the form should carry both the required and aria-required attributes and their labels should include a readable note.



// Error List
// For long forms when there is an error display a summary list of form errors at the top of the form.
