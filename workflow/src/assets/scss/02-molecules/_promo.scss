// Sticky Promo Card
// The primary purpose of the Sticky Card component is to ensure that the content it’s promoting remains a constant on the page -- always visible within the viewport no matter a user’s scroll position. Sticky Promo Cards can be used to promote a product and provide a CTA. While the card itself is both content and context agnostic, it should only be used strategically on pages where it will be most effective.
