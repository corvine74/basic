		Tips
			Avoid using button styling for ordinary links that simply lead to another page. Buttons should typically trigger some specific action. Buttons do things; links go places.
			
			That said, sometimes the action is to visit another page. A strong call to action might be a link styled as a button. Use them wisely.
